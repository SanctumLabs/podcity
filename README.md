# PodCity

PodCity is a simple web application that aggregates podcasts from various sources and _feeds_ them to you.
Inspiration comes from people who listen to multiple podcasts and want one place to access them all and also inspiration 
ideally just comes from apps like Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify and the likes.

This uses the [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28standard%29) standard to aggregate the feeds as most feeds 
follow this standard, making the aggregation process simpler.
